[Monty Hall problem][1]

Player variants:
- `donkey` always stays with their initial choice
- `switcher` always switches when offered

Host variants:
- `knows-it-all` knows what's behind the doors
- `random` doesn't know hence acts random

Win rate for `i_GAMES = 100.000`, `n_DOORS = 3` and `k_REWARDS = 1`:

_ | **know-it-all** | **random**
--- | --- | ---
**donkey** | 33.46% | 33.40%
**switcher** | 66.67% | 33.53%
